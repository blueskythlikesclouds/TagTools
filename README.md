# Havoc
This branch is for the C# rewrite of TagTools. It's currently not finished but the library can read/write binary tagfiles, and Havoc.Reloaded can dump type compendiums from games with Reloaded Mod Loader.  
If you want to create your own Havok tool and want to use Havoc for reference, feel free to do so as long as you credit. Havoc contains the work of my latest Havok research and TagTools is **very** outdated in that regard.
